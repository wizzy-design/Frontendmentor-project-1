## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is a solution to the [Huddle landing page with curved sections challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-curved-sections-5ca5ecd01e82137ec91a50f2). 

I achieved this by using HTML & CSS. Flexbox was my very valuable tool that i used to arrange the pictures and content side by side.
